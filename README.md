# todo-list
Creating a todo-list from TheOdinProject with webpack

What it does:
- It is a to do list that can contains different projects and tasks under each project
- Users can easily add in different projects or school modules or school subjects etc and place different colour label for each projects
- Users can also add in different tasks for each projects with details of each tasks, such as due date, description of tasks and whether it is of high priority

How it is built
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Data is saved using local storage

Challenges faced:
- As it was my first time working with so many js scripts, I was sometimes confused by the imports and exports
- It was my first time using local storage so it took me quite a while to figure out how to save different tasks and projects so they do not get over written
- Faced quite a number of issues and bugs when implementing the delete and display functions such as all the other tasks not displaying after deleting one task

Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
- Continuously trying without giving up even though new bugs and issues kept surfacing after resolving old ones

What I learnt:
- The importance of planning ahead before coding as I only focused on drawing out how the webpage should look like during the planning phase. I should have focused on what functions are required, how to make the connection between functions etc
- Utilising local storage to save data so that the display remains even after webpage refreshes
- Using multiple js scripts and functions, drawing the connections between them and making them work
- Persistance and never give up

Next steps:
- More work needs to be done with regards to the styling
- Adding more tabs to the sidebar such as a "Today" tab for tasks due today, "Importance" tab for tasks that are high priority and "Overdue" tab for tasks that are overdued
- Made it responsive to phone and tablets
- Sign in/ create account function
